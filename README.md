This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start the server
```
npm install
npm start
```

## More details
The demo app creates chart object via object based approach.

But there is a json way of plotting charts as well(https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/getting-started/basics/#Using_JSON)
